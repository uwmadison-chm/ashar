# Ashar task

This is a port of the [CANlab's 2016 Ashar compassion and charitable donation task](https://github.com/canlab/Paradigms_Public/tree/master/2016_Ashar_Empathy_CompassionMeditation/EPrimeScripts) to [lab.js](https://lab.js.org/).

Audio stimuli have been lightly edited in an attempt to improve quality.

Instructions were housed outside the task to allow for easier editing.

## Instructions from REDCap

When you click the link below, it will open the DONATION TASK in a new browser window. You will need to use a computer with speakers or headphones to complete this task.

Once you begin, you will listen to a series of short audio clips describing real-life stories of real people. After each audio clip, you will be asked to rate how you are feeling toward the person in the video. 

Please rate how strongly you are feeling each emotion and only that emotion.  For example, if we ask about anger, and you only feel sadness, please say that you don't feel anger. 

Some of the emotions we ask about may not describe your experience at all -- in that case, just say you aren't feeling them at all.

-------
Comprehension check:

If I am not feeling the particular emotion being asked about, I should:
1. Say that I am not feeling it
2. Just rate how emotional I am feeling in general
-------

Many of the emotions we will ask you about are self-explanatory, but there is one we want to explain a little further. 

By "tender," we mean a feeling of caring, openness, and warmth toward another person.

-------
Comprehension check:

Which of these is what we mean by feeling "tender"?
1, Feeling generally positive
2, A feeling of care, openness, and warmth
3, Feeling distressed and upset
------- 

...then there's some stuff about not closing the browser window and a comprehension check to make sure they understand that they will need to return to this window. Then the actual link.
