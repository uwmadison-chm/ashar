# Ashar task

This is a port of the [CANlab's 2016 Ashar compassion and charitable donation task](https://github.com/canlab/Paradigms_Public/tree/master/2016_Ashar_Empathy_CompassionMeditation/EPrimeScripts) to [lab.js](https://lab.js.org/).

Audio stimuli have been lightly edited in an attempt to improve quality.

Instructions were housed outside the task to allow for easier editing.

## Instructions from REDCap

When you click the link below, it will open the DONATION TASK in a new browser window. You will need to use a computer with speakers or headphones to complete this task.

Once you begin, you will listen to a series of short audio clips describing real-life stories of real people. After each audio clip, you will be asked to rate how you are feeling toward the person in the video. 

Please rate how strongly you are feeling each emotion and only that emotion.  For example, if we ask about anger, and you only feel sadness, please say that you don't feel anger. 

Some of the emotions we ask about may not describe your experience at all -- in that case, just say you aren't feeling them at all.

-------

Comprehension check:

If I am not feeling the particular emotion being asked about, I should:

1. Say that I am not feeling it
2. Just rate how emotional I am feeling in general

-------

Many of the emotions we will ask you about are self-explanatory, but there is one we want to explain a little further. 

By "tender," we mean a feeling of caring, openness, and warmth toward another person.

-------

Comprehension check:

Which of these is what we mean by feeling "tender"?

1. Feeling generally positive
2. A feeling of care, openness, and warmth
3. Feeling distressed and upset

------- 

*Donation and Payment:*

After listening to each story, you will also be given the opportunity to make a voluntary donation.

Please read this information carefully:

    In addition to the rest of the payment you will earn for participating in this study, we are giving you an additional $5 for this task. You can choose to donate all, part, or none of this $5. Whatever portion of the $5 you do not donate will be paid to you.
    After listening to each story, you will have the chance to donate between $0 and $5 to that individual.
    You will listen to the first half of the stories now, and the second half of them at the end of the study.
    At the end of the study, ONE of the individuals in these stories will be chosen at random. The amount you chose to donate to that person will be donated to a charity that helps people having similar difficulties. Whatever amount you chose not to donate to that person will be paid to you, along with the rest of the money you have earned for the full study.
    For each individual story, you will make a new decision about how much of the $5 you choose to donate or keep. This means that every donation is unrelated to all the other donations. It does NOT make sense to divide your money among people. Only ONE person gets chosen at the end (i.e. Bob), so it will not matter how much you donated to Sally or Joe!

-------

Comprehension check:

Say you choose to donate $3 to Sally, $2 to Bob, and $1 to Joe. At the end of the study, Bob is randomly chosen. In this scenario, how much money will you get paid and how much will be donated?
1. $2 to charity, and you'd get paid the other $3 that you didn't donate when you receive your full payment at the end of the study
2. $0 to charity, and you'd get paid $7 total
3. $15 to charity, and you'd get paid $25

-------

Comprehension check:

Do I need to divide my money between people?
1. No. Only one donation will be chosen at random, and all that will matter is what you donated to that person.
2. Yes. You have $5 that you must split between everyone.

-------

...then there's some stuff about not closing the browser window and a comprehension check to make sure they understand that they will need to return to this window. Then the actual link.
